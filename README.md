# CPS109-A2
This was my second assignment in my introduction to programming class (CPS 109). In this assignment we were to read a file and to extract information from the file
and to write the information to another file. The functions were were to implement...
- Count the number of lines in a file
- Read a file and find all of the overlapping pairs and write them to one file and write all the unique pairs to another file 
- Read a file of questions and answers and to create a dictionary with the question as the key and the answer as the value 
- Read all the questions from one file and to write them to another
- Read all the answers from one file and to write them to another 
- Read a file and count the frequency for each word in that file
- Sort the frequencies of each word from most frequent to least and to write this information to a file
A practice file was also made to test my functions
Language Used: Python
Main Concepts Covered: Functions, Ddctionaries, File I/O and Unit Testing
